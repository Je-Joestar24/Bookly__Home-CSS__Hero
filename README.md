# Bookly__Home-CSS__Hero

This submodule contains the CSS files and modules specifically designed for the **Hero** section of the Home page in the **Bookly** project. It is nested under the main `Bookly__Home-CSS` submodule and is responsible for all styling related to the Hero section, making it modular and easier to manage.

## Purpose

The `Bookly__Home-CSS__Hero` submodule is dedicated to the **Hero section** of the Home page. The Hero section typically includes the prominent content displayed at the top of the Home page, such as large banners, introductory text, and call-to-action buttons. This submodule allows developers to focus on styling the Hero section without interfering with other sections of the Home page.

## File Structure

- **CSS/Home/Hero/**: This directory contains the CSS specific to the Hero section of the Home page. It is a part of the overall Home page styling but is separated into its own module for better maintainability.

## Features

- **Modular Hero Styling**: All CSS related to the Hero section is kept separate from other Home page sections, ensuring cleaner and more manageable code.
- **Flexibility**: Developers can easily add or modify CSS rules for the Hero section without affecting other sections of the Home page.
- **Responsiveness**: The Hero section styles are built to ensure responsiveness across devices, ensuring the Hero section looks great on all screen sizes.

## Usage

1. To add the `Bookly__Home-CSS__Hero` submodule to your main project, run the following command:
   ```bash
   git submodule add <repository-url> CSS/Home/Hero
   ```

2. Once added, the Hero section's styles will be located in the `CSS/Home/Hero/` directory.

3. To include the Hero section styles in the main Home page CSS, ensure that the parent `home.css` (located in `CSS/Home/`) includes the link to this submodule. You can reference it in the `home.css` by importing the Hero submodule's CSS.

4. Modify or extend the Hero section's styling by editing the CSS files within the `CSS/Home/Hero/` directory.

5. To update the submodule, run the following command in the main project:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --remote CSS/Home/Hero
   ```

## Example Structure

Once the submodule is added, the following structure will be in place:

```
project/
  ├── CSS/
  │   └── Home/
  │       ├── home.css          # Parent CSS file that includes the Hero submodule
  │       └── Hero/             # `Bookly__Home-CSS__Hero` submodule
  │           └── hero.css      # CSS file for Hero section
```

## Notes

- The `Bookly__Home-CSS__Hero` submodule is intended for all Hero section-related styles. It is imported into the main `home.css` file from the parent submodule.
- Future updates to the Hero section styles should be made within the `CSS/Home/Hero/` directory, and developers should commit changes to this submodule separately from the parent `Bookly__Home-CSS` submodule.
- Ensure that the `home.css` properly imports and uses this submodule's CSS to ensure the Hero section is styled correctly within the main project.
